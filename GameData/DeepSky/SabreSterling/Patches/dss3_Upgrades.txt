	description = There comes a point where things built from metal just can't take anymore heat and will explode. In anticipation we've found what we're looking for in certain ceramics. Of course, it will be incredibly costly to produce and mould the ceramic into the shapes we need. But for survivability's sake, the added costs are worth it.
